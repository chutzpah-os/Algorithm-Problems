# Tit-for-Tat Game Theory System ðŸŽ®

A comprehensive interactive system for studying game theory strategies, featuring the famous Tit-for-Tat algorithm and other classic strategies in the Prisoner's Dilemma.

##  Overview

This project implements a visual and interactive simulation of various game theory strategies, with a focus on the Tit-for-Tat algorithm that won Robert Axelrod's tournaments in the 1980s. The system allows users to play against AI strategies or run automated simulations between different algorithms.

## Features

### Game Modes
- **Human vs Tit-for-Tat**: Interactive gameplay against the TFT algorithm
- **AI vs AI Simulation**: Automated tournaments between different strategies
- **Real-time scoring** and detailed game history
- **Visual payoff matrix** for educational purposes

### Implemented Strategies
- **Tit-for-Tat (TFT)**: Cooperates first, then mimics opponent's last move
- **Always Cooperate**: Unconditionally cooperative strategy
- **Always Defect**: Unconditionally defective strategy
- **Random**: 50/50 probability for each action
- **Grudger**: Cooperates until first defection, then always defects
- **Generous Tit-for-Tat**: TFT with 10% forgiveness probability

##  Game Theory Background

### The Prisoner's Dilemma
The Prisoner's Dilemma is a fundamental game in game theory that demonstrates why rational individuals might not cooperate, even when it would be in their mutual interest to do so.

**Payoff Matrix:**
```
                Opponent
                C    D
Player    C   3,3  0,5
          D   5,0  1,1
```
Where:
- C = Cooperate, D = Defect
- Format: (Player points, Opponent points)

### Other Notable Game Theory Algorithms

#### 1. **Nash Equilibrium Strategies**
- **Mixed Strategy Nash**: Randomized strategies that make opponents indifferent
- **Pure Strategy Nash**: Deterministic best responses

#### 2. **Evolutionary Strategies**
- **Hawk-Dove**: Aggressive vs peaceful strategies in resource competition
- **Bourgeois**: Respects property/territory ownership
- **Assessor**: Evaluates opponent strength before deciding

#### 3. **Cooperative Strategies**
- **Pavlov (Win-Stay, Lose-Shift)**: Repeats successful moves, changes after poor outcomes
- **Generous Tit-for-Tat**: Forgives defection with some probability
- **Tit-for-Two-Tats**: Only retaliates after two consecutive defections

#### 4. **Punishing Strategies**
- **Grim Trigger**: Cooperates until first defection, then permanent retaliation
- **Suspicious Tit-for-Tat**: Starts with defection, then mimics
- **Two Tits for Tat**: Defects twice for each opponent defection

#### 5. **Reputation-Based Strategies**
- **Image Scoring**: Maintains reputation scores for all players
- **Stern Judging**: Punishes those who defect against cooperators
- **Standing**: Forgives defection against defectors

#### 6. **Learning Algorithms**
- **Q-Learning**: Reinforcement learning approach to strategy evolution
- **Genetic Algorithms**: Evolutionary computation for strategy optimization
- **Neural Networks**: Deep learning approaches to game strategy

#### 7. **Zero-Sum Game Algorithms**
- **Minimax**: Minimizes maximum possible loss
- **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: Optimized minimax for game trees
- **Monte Carlo Tree Search**: Probabilistic search algorithm

#### 8. **Auction Theory Algorithms**
- **Vickrey Auction**: Second-price sealed-bid auction
- **English Auction**: Open ascending-bid auction
- **Dutch Auction**: Open descending-bid auction

#### 9. **Mechanism Design**
- **Groves Mechanisms**: Truth-telling incentive mechanisms
- **VCG (Vickrey-Clarke-Groves)**: Generalized auction mechanism
- **Myerson Auction**: Revenue-optimal auction design
